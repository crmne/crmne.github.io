# Hi there, I'm Carmine Paolino.

![Me]({{ "/images/me.jpeg" | absolute_url }})

I'm a Data Scientist, DJ, and climber.

By day I use Machine Learning to provide users of [OLX](http://www.olx.com/)'s apps a better experience; by night I play electronic music as [Ground Method](https://soundcloud.com/groundmethod) to make people dance, and dance myself. ;)

This website is the home of my research, code, and my music. I'm especially interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, and Music Information Retrieval.

I wrote a [book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-9242-9_6) on distributed social network analysis.

Sometimes I take [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/crmne/) while travelling.
